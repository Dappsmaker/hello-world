# hello-world

Hey everyone!

I am an undergrad economics and computer science student very excited about the potential for blockchain tech and decentralized applications to change the way humans and machines interact and open doors for the financially disregarded. I initally got into bitcoin early 2015 and then discovered ethereum late 2015 and that has been my major interest since. I am in the beginning stages of learning solidity and writing full stack smart contracts.
